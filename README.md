# Onchain ID

Onchain ID is a decentralized onchain identity standard built on Ethereum and ENS.

It enables wallets, robots, devices, vehicles, and AI agents to have unique,
verifiable, human-readable identities onchain.

## Why Onchain ID
Traditional identity systems are centralized and not designed for autonomous
software or machines. Onchain ID provides a permissionless, interoperable
identity layer for the internet of value.

## Why ENS
- Proven naming infrastructure
- Native wallet and exchange support
- Human-readable identifiers
- Cross-chain resolution via CCIP-Read

## Use Cases
- Wallet identities
- Robot & autonomous machine IDs
- Device & IoT identities
- Vehicle & fleet identities
- AI agent identities

## Networks
- Ethereum
- Base
